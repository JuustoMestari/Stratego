Stratego
========

> Stratego is a strategy board game for two players on a 10Ã—10 square board. Each player controls 40 pieces representing individual officers and soldiers in an army. The objective of the game is to find and capture the opponent's Flag, or to capture so many enemy pieces that the opponent cannot make any further moves. Players cannot see the ranks of one another's pieces, so disinformation and discovery are important facets to gameplay.

This project contains the core of the game and its mechanics, no GUI. It can be used easily with any UI. Program.cs contains an example on how to use it.

~~I will try to create a simple Store app to show how it works.~~
Stratego_GUI.zip => WPF App ( Stratego\Stratego\bin\Debug\Stratego.exe)
